# Question 1 : Detailed information on the analysis.

## DATA : 
The data used for this analysis comes from the experiment.csv file, which can be found at (https://osf.io) by typing in experiment.csv and selecting the file authored by Jose Gabriel Nino Barreat. The CSV is also linked to this git hub repository. The data from the csv file consists of two coloumns with headings 't' and 'N'. 't' is the time passed  measured in minutes and 'N' is the population size of the bacteria (_Escherichia coli_) that we are studying.


## Plotting the data
The analysis began with a plotting of the data to observe the general trends. To do this we read in our data and we first plot a graph with a continuous x and y axis. The time is plotted on the x axis and the population sixe is plotted on the y axis. We then plotted a second graph, this time with a log base 10 transformation was applied to our y variable , the population size.

The first plot exhibits a sigmoidal curve under what appears to be logisitc growth. It starts at a low population size and begins to rapidly accelerate at around 1500 minutes. It then plateaus off at 2000 minutes with a population size of around 60,000,000,000 (60 billion)

The Second plot exhibits a linear growth (on the log base 10 transformed y axis) with a plateau at
